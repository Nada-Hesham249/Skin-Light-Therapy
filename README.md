# Skin-Light-Therapy
This project was conducted as part of the **Medical Physics** course, focusing on the development of a non-invasive skin treatment method using principles of light therapy and sound waves.

### Objective :

The goal is to design a treatment system that utilizes different types of **light radiation** and **sound technology** to address various skin conditions and promote overall skin health.

### Technologies Used :

- **Red Light & Infrared Radiation** – for inflammation treatment  
- **Blue Light** – for acne treatment  
- **Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation** – for eczema treatment  
- **Sound Waves** – to enhance the effectiveness of light therapy and support deeper penetration

### Aim of the Study :

The project investigates the **combined therapeutic effects** of light and sound modalities, evaluating their potential to improve skin condition in a safe and effective way.
